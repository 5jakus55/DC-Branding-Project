# SJ Develop Branding Project



## Introduction

Hello world, I want you to introduce my brand new logo project. This logo is for my development company named SJ Develop. It is software development company with high-qualified developers. I did research on many development companies and logos to gain the most precise quality and look of logo. My project composes of RESEARCH, where I am describing what logos and websites were most inspiring for me, SKETCHES, where you can see all my initial drawings, FINAL LOGO PROCESS in which I am describing process of creating a final logo, PAGE, where I am writing about approach of creating a website, BUSSINESS CARD that I present as my own business card as a web designer and developer, STYLE GUIDE, which is a set of standards that defines my company’s branding and where I am explaining which colours I used, what fonts I applied and also final look of logo, FINAL WORDS about my project and RESOURCES.

## Sketches

After research, I started with sketching some simple SJ logos. I used different shapes, fonts, angles and sizes. I was trying to create some unique logo that stays in mind. I continued sketching the first possible candidate for logo, which was the one with reversed J connected with S, with the lines inside. I drew black logo on white canvas, white logo on black canvas, but I knew I can create something better, so I continued with sketching. I was trying to connect my initials from different sides, putting inside the letters different lines, squares and circles. I did like the idea of SJ logo inside the square, so I tried it in two ways. One with incomplete square and angular letters as a part of square, and the second one with complete square, but incomplete circle inside that looks like S. I used for incomplete square logo yellow and red colours to see if the SJ letters inside are readable, but they weren’t. I also tried to improve the second square logo, but I think that people wouldn’t know that inside are letters S and J without logo company name and that’s not what I wanted. I tried to create names for my company, such as JanoS design or SonJa design, but I didn’t like the pronunciation of them. And that’s when I found and drew my future logo. I sketched the J letter on top of S letter and connected them on their ends. I found it very simple and with some shades inside it would be beautiful.

## Final logo progress

I created my logo in Adobe Illustrator app. It was the first time for me using this application, but our teacher introduced the app and gave us helpful tools. I also watched a few tutorials to make this app user friendly to me. I started using ellipses to improve the shapes of letter S, then added lines for letter J and tried to find the right angles to make it good enough. When I was happy with the look of the object, I divided the whole object to delete unwanted parts of the future logo. After dividing object, I used pen tool to improve top corner of letter S and also the other parts, such as connected part of S and J and the end of letter J. I used for letters two different colours (black and grey) to separate them and started thinking about final colour for logo. I chose purple colour, because this colour is with me from childhood. It is my best colour, because it represents me as a person. I decide for the darker purple shade, because dark purples give me a sense wealth, luxury**,** accuracy and high quality. I used three shades of purple to my final logo. I was thinking what are the best parts of logo for shadowing. I found four parts of logo. The first shadow is at the beginning of the letter J, the other two shadows are where the letter S intersects with the letter J, and the last shadow is where the letter J merges with the letter S. I also lightened the end of the letter J with lighter purple. Finally, I added a word develop led to the logo. I put the letters in the word below them and I used font Adobe 宋体 Std L. In the end I created my professional logo in three colours. The main one is purple, then black logo on white canvas and white logo on black canvas.
